    <h1>Call Stack: [Main code (synchronous)]<br>
        Microtask Queue (VIP): [Promise callback]<br>
        Event Queue: [setTimeout, events]<br>
    </h1>
    <pre>
        1. Call Stack:
        The Call Stack is where the JavaScript engine executes your synchronous codeâ€”line by line.
        
3. Event Queue (Regular Queue for setTimeout, etc.):
        <h1>
            setTimeout(): Executes a function after a specified delay (even if it's 0ms).<br>
            setInterval(): Repeatedly executes a function at a specified interval.
        </h1>
setTimeout() / setInterval(): Timed callbacks.
DOM Events: User-triggered events like clicks and key presses.
I/O Operations: File read/write, network requests.
setImmediate() (Node.js): Callback after I/O events.
requestAnimationFrame(): Browser animation-related tasks.
Other Async APIs: Events from Web APIs like WebSockets, fetch, etc
How it works: After the delay, the callback is executed only when the Call Stack is empty.

        Promise:
        What it does: Represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allows chaining .then() or .catch().
        How it works: Promises use the Microtask Queue. They get executed after the current execution context but before the Event Queue.
        Promises go into a VIP queue called the Microtask Queue, which gives them priority over the normal Event Queue (the "waiting" queue, like the one setTimeout uses).
        When a Promise is resolved or rejected, its .then() or .catch() callback gets placed in the Microtask Queue.
        The Microtask Queue has higher priority than the Event Queue (where setTimeout, setInterval, and other events go).
        Promises are executed after the Call Stack is empty but before any other tasks in the Event Queue.
