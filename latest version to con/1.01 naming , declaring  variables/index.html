        Variables are Containers for Storing Data
        JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
        
        Automatically
        Using var
        Using let
        Using const
        
        
        JavaScript Identifiers
        All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
        
        These unique names are called identifiers.
        
        Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
        
        The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
        
        Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
        Names must begin with a letter.
        Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
        Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
        Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
           
        
        
        Declaring a JavaScript Variable
        var carName;
        or:
        let carName;
