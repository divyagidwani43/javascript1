        Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

        JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.
        
        ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
        
        These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:
        
        Example
        Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
        
        {
          let x = 2;
        }
        // x can NOT be used here  
    </pre>
    <h1> function scope</h1>

    <h1>global</h1>
    <pre>
Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.

Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope:

Example
Variables declared with varinside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:

{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here
    </pre>
