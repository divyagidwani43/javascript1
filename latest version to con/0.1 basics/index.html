        A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

        In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
        

        <b>statements -></b>
        A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements
        
        The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
        
        Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
        
        When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
        
        JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.


        <b>white-space -></b>
        JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.


        <b>code-block -></b>
        JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

        
        <b>syntax</b>
        avaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:

        // How to create variables:
        var x;
        let y;

        // How to use variables:
        x = 5;
        let z = x + y;


        <b>JavaScript Values</b>
        The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

        Fixed values
        Fixed values are called Literals.

        ex-1 Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
        "John Doe"
        'John Doe'

        Variable values
        Variable values are called Variables.
        In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
        JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.


        <b>JavaScript Operators</b>
        JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:
        JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:


        <b>JavaScript Expressions        </b>
        An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
        The computation is called an evaluation.
        For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:
        Expressions can also contain variable values:
        x * 10

        The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
        For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe":
        "John" + " " + "Doe"


        <b>JavaScript Keywords        </b>
        JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.
        The let keyword tells the browser to create variables


        <b>JavaScript Comments</b>
        Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".
        Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
        Comments are ignored, and will not be executed
        
        
        <b>javaScript Identifiers / Names</b>
        Identifiers are JavaScript names.
        Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
        The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.
        
        
        <b>A JavaScript name must begin with</b>
        A letter (A-Z or a-z)
        A dollar sign ($)
        Or an underscore (_)
        
        
        
        <b>JavaScript is Case Sensitive</b>
        All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 
        The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables
